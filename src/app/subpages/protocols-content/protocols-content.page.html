                  followed
                  by manual removal (rather than the use of automated devices) of the helmet, while keeping neck
                  motion
                  manually restricted. Occipital padding
                  should be applied, as needed, with the patient in a supine position, in order to maintain

                  clinical situation
                  specifically warrants long board use. Padded scoop stretchers, vacuum splints, or a secured
                  ambulance
                  cot are all appropriate options for SMR. An example
                  of an indication for long board use may be facilitation of immobilization of multiple extremity
                  injuries or an unstable patient where removal of a board will delay transport and/or other
                  treatment
                  priorities. In these rare situations, long
                  boards should be padded or have a vacuum mattress applied to minimize secondary injury to the

              <strong>Key Considerations:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li [appHighlight]="searchTerm">Patients who have a low likelihood of spinal injury and are therefore
                  not likely to benefit
                  from
                  SMR, should not be immobilized </li>
                <li [appHighlight]="searchTerm">Patients should be "log rolled," with maintenance of spinal alignment,
                  for examination of the
                  spine
                  for tenderness and deformities</li>
                <li [appHighlight]="searchTerm">Ambulatory patients who are alert and cooperative may be safely
                  immobilized on a gurney with
                  cervical collar and straps and will not generally require a spine board</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Pediatric Considerations
              <ul>
                <li [appHighlight]="searchTerm">Age &lt;2 should be secured in a car seat or age appropriate papoose
                  device</li>
                <li [appHighlight]="searchTerm">Children who are &lt;5 years old should be secured with an
                  appropriately-sized cervical collar
                  or
                  soft towel rolls and tape, if tolerated. If attempts at SMR result in more distress and fighting
                  to
                  get free, then the SMR should be minimized</li>
                <li [appHighlight]="searchTerm">Children under the age of 8 cannot have their cervical spines reliably
                  assessed in the field
                  and
                  should have the cervical spine immobilized if the mechanism warrants it</li>
                <li [appHighlight]="searchTerm">Children do not require full SMR if isolated injury to the cervical
                  spine is suspected as
                  their risk
                  for noncontiguous spinal injuries is much lower than adults</li>
                <li [appHighlight]="searchTerm">Use a pediatric specific backboard for those &lt;8 years old OR use a
                  towel or pad to raise
                  the
                  child’s body (not their head) to insure appropriate spinal alignment on an adult board</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li [appHighlight]="searchTerm">Contact OLMC for further instructions if the patient refuses immobilization
